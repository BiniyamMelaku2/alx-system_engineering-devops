## Tasks

## [0. Install MySQL](./)
First things first, letâ€™s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

* MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x

## [1. Let us in!](./)
* Create a MySQL user named holberton_user on both web-01 and web-02 with the host name set to localhost and the password projectcorrection280hbtn. This will allow us to access the replication status on both servers.
* Make sure that holberton_user has permission to check the primary/replica status of your databases.
* In addition to that, make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. You will likely need to add the public key to web-02 as you only added it to web-01 for this project. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status
