## General
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
* This project will be manually reviewed:
* As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
* Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
* For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
* After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
* You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
* Focus on what you are being asked:
* Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
* Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
* Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
* In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked

# Tasks

## 0. Simple web stack
  A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure, a lot of time it is composed of a single server with a [LAMP stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29).

On a whiteboard, design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com. Start your explanation by having a user wanting to access your website.

Requirements:

You must use:

  * 1 server
  * 1 web server (Nginx)
  * 1 application server
  * 1 application files (your code base)
  * 1 database (MySQL)
  * 1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8

You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

  * What is a server
  * What is the role of the domain name
  * What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
  * What is the role of the web server
  * What is the role of the application server
  * What is the role of the database
  * What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website

You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:

  * SPOF
  * Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
  * Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic

## 1. Distributed web infrastructure
  On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.

Requirements:

You must add:-

   * 2 servers
   * 1 web server (Nginx)
   * 1 application server
   * 1 load-balancer (HAproxy)
   * 1 set of application files (your code base)
   * 1 database (MySQL)

You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

   * For every additional element, why you are adding it
   * What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
   * Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
   * How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
   * What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application

You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
   * Where are SPOF
   * Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
   * No monitoring
